# Animated Border

Animated borders for any block level element. This plugin creates an animated border with configurable thickness and color.

It does this by adding 4 absolutely positioned divs around the element. The 4 highlight divs use an animated gif with white blocks and transparent areas. This allows the background of the div to be visible and be treated as the color of the animated border.
